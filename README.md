# Ad-Movies-Phase-1-Project

JavaScript App that fetches a response from movies.json file and displays the movies in categories. Users can also post reviews and favourite a movie.

## Demo



## Setup

Run this command to get the backend started:

```console
$ json-server --watch movies.json
```

Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:

[http://localhost:3000/movies](http://localhost:3000/movies)

Then, open the `index.html` file on your browser to run the application.


## Core Deliverables

   vote count, popularity etc** when the page loads. You will need to make a GET

3. Buy a ticket for a movie. After clicking the "Buy Ticket" button, I should
   see the number of available tickets decreasing on the frontend. I should not
   be able to buy a ticket if the showing is sold out (if there are 0 tickets
   available). **No persistence is needed for this feature**.

### Bonus Deliverables

These bonus deliverables are here if you want an extra challenge and won't
affect your score. **Make sure to commit your work to save your progress before
attempting the bonus deliverables!**

1. Click on a movie in the menu to replace the currently displayed movie's
   details with the new movie's details. Note that you may have to make an
   additional GET request to access the movie's details.

2. When a movie is sold out (when there are no available tickets remaining),
   indicate that the movie is sold out by changing the button text to "Sold
   Out". Also update the film item in the `ul#films` menu by adding a class of
   `sold-out` to the film. For reference, here's what the contents of the
   `ul#films` element should look like with a sold out film:

   ```html
   <li class="film item">(Title of film)</li>
   <li class="sold-out film item">(Title of a sold-out film)</li>
   <li class="film item">(Title of film)</div>
   ```

## Extra Bonus

These extra bonus deliverables involve using `fetch` to update data on the
`json-server` backend by using `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests. These are
meant for an extra, extra challenge and won't affect your grade. **Make sure to
commit your work to save your progress before attempting the extra bonus
deliverables!**

1. When a ticket is purchased, persist the updated number of `tickets_sold` on
   the server. Remember, the frontend shows the number of available tickets
   based on the `tickets_sold` and the `capacity`, so only the `tickets_sold`
   should be updated on the backend when a ticket is purchased. You will need to
   make a request that follows this structure:

   ```txt
   PATCH /films/:id

   Request Headers: {
     Content-Type: application/json
   }

   Request Body: {
     "tickets_sold": 28
   }
   ----
   Example Response:
   {
      "id": "1",
      "title": "The Giant Gila Monster",
      "runtime": "108",
      "capacity": 30,
      "showtime": "04:00PM",
      "tickets_sold": 28,
      "description": "A giant lizard terrorizes a rural Texas community and a heroic teenager attempts to destroy the creature.",
      "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/2157/p2157_v_v8_ab.jpg"
   }
   ```

2. Delete a film from the server. Add a delete button next to each film in the
   `ul#films` menu. When the button is clicked, remove the film from the list
   and also delete the film on the server:

   ```txt
   DELETE /films/:id

   Example Response:
   {}
   ```
